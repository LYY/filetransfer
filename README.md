* what is filetransfer
  filetransfer is my first sinatra app on cloudfoundry.com. It's based on ruby. It used to transfer file directly throw the web, or download it to server and then download to local.
    I just what it to cross my office firewall which is blocked exe file or a file which is from a ftp service.
